    # The Builder class is the core for the versioning definition block processing.
    # There are three methods you really need to pay attention to:
    #
    # - repository
    # - field
    # - commit
    #
    # The repository is an optional declaration that defines where the git 
    # repository will be saved.  You only need declare this once, you could
    # have a different repository per model if you wanted.  But why would you?
    #
    # The field method defines which field will be stored in the repository.
    # 
    # Commit takes a hash of options:
    #   message : a proc which returns a string (run in the instance scope)
    #     e.g. :message => lambda { "Committed by #{current_user.login}" }
    #

        # file_path, or leave this to the default: 'RAILS_ROOT/git_store/#{plural_model_name}'
